# Ironman
This repository looks at some rudimentary statistics for Ironman Nice.  The question "what is a good time?" is generally met with the response "well that depends on...." The goal here is to show the distribution of times, and based on your perceived capability with respect to your peers, make yourself a goal. 

If anyone takes the time to read through this, I hope it helps you, and good luck on the day.
